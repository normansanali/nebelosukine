class=imageCaption>Queenie Tan (pictured), from Sydney, said her financial success gradually accumulated over time after she started researching and investing when she was 19</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox mol-style-medium">1. Buy good quality items that last</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While it can be tempting to buy cheap appliances and items when you’re trying to save money, the 24-year-old said quality is always key.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘When you buy the cheapest things you can find, often these things don’t really last, and that’s why it’s important to invest in good quality items, particularly electronic items,’ Queenie said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She recently bought a good quality stove top, a good oven, a good dishwasher and a good quality coffee machine – as these are things she uses the whole time.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I used to spend about $1,500 a year on cafe-bought coffee, but now I have a good quality coffee machine that means I can make my coffee for just 80 cents a cup at home,’ Queenie said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox mol-style-medium">2. Schedule everything so it runs off peak</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The second thing Queenie said you need to do is schedule all of your appliances so that they run at their cheapest time, which is often at night.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I schedule my dishwasher so that it runs in the evenings, which is my off-peak time and helps me to save money on electricity,’ she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Queenie also recommends buying energy-saving appliances wherever possible, as that means more dollars off your bills.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox mol-style-medium">3. Buy in bulk when something is on special</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>If there is an item you love and you know you’re going to get through it and buy it again, Queenie recommends bulk buying the item when it is on special or on deal.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I drink Bonsoy soy milk with my coffee and my breakfast, so whenever it’s on Special, I buy heaps of it and store it away so I always have some on hand when I need it,’ Queenie said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This works especially well with groceries and toiletries when you do your supermarket shop.</p><img decoding=async id=i-daf1f681cd5ef802 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/01/21/03/38288758-9170341-image-a-34_1611200226958.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Queenie's (pictured) tips include shopping around online and buying something in bulk when it's on special to save money" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><img decoding=async id=i-daf1f681cd5ef802 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/01/21/03/38288758-9170341-image-a-34_1611200226958.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Queenie's (pictured) tips include shopping around online and buying something in bulk when it's on special to save money" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=imageCaption>Queenie’s (pictured) tips include shopping around online and buying something in bulk when it’s on special to save money</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox mol-style-medium">4. Shop around online&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Queenie recommends that you always shop around online and look at different websites to compare all prices.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘A good website that I love is called Price Hipster, as this helps you to compare how much the exact same appliance costs on different websites,’ Queenie said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘You can also set price alerts on Oz Bargain, so you always get the best deal.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox mol-style-medium">5. Sleep on a big purchase</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When it comes to buying something, Queenie said she always sleeps on it if it’s a big-purchase buy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Some of the biggest mistakes I’ve made when I’ve bought something big is when I impulse spend without taking the time to think about it,’ Queenie said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Whenever I buy anything over $100, I always sleep on it and wait a little while before I buy first.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox mol-style-medium">6. Use a shopping list</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The 24-year-old religiously uses a shopping list when she goes to the supermarket, and she tries as much as possible to only buy things from her list.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Look at the price per unit when you’re in the supermarket and try to find the cheapest price per unit for your favourite products,’ she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘For me personally, I try to buy non-branded items whenever I can, as often you can’t really tell the difference.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox mol-style-medium">7. Look at cost per use&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When it comes to her wardrobe, Queenie said she operates by the cost per use rule when buying clothes.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘When I started buying clothes and wanted to save money, I used to buy really cheap items that never lasted,’ she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘But then I discovered that spending a little bit more money upfront will save me money in the future.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Queenie said she looks for high-quality items that won’t go out of style, and when she thinks she’ll get lots of wear out of an item, she buys it even if it’s expensive.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox mol-style-medium">9. Finish something before buying something new</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Finally, Queenie said she always tries to finish something before she buys something new.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘For example, with a lipstick, I try to finish one before I buy a new one,’ she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I do this with makeup, skincare and clothes.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The 24-year-old said doing this helps her to stop accumulating more things than she needs and won’t use.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘We can spend money on anything we want in this life, but we can’t spend money on everything,’ Queenie said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘So you need to prioritise what is important to you.’</p><img decoding=async

class=mol-para-with-font>Speaking previously to FEMAIL, Queenie revealed how she built her wealth.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Through listening to audiobooks, Queenie quickly learnt investing was the key to generating a passive income to work towards achieving financial flexibility and freedom.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She now has a diverse financial portfolio and an impressive net worth that she shares with her partner, as they purchased their first property together in 2019 worth $500,000 with a $100,000 deposit.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Each month Queenie is able to invest up to $5,000 through her six sources of income as well as using the equity from the apartment.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Queenie admitted she dropped out of her marketing degree and decided to apply for jobs, as she was living from pay check to pay check and earning only $400 per week.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘When I was 19 and moved out of home I had no savings and working only covered the bare minimum, so I decided to take a chance to drop out of university – thankfully it paid off,’ she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The impressive net worth is calculated by the total number of assets, minus any debt.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said these assets include her property value, stock and cryptocurrency portfolio, Offset account, savings and superannuation, but the home loan debt of $455,000 is the only liability.</p><h3 class=mol-factbox-title>What are Queenie’s tips for saving money?&nbsp;</h3><p class=mol-para-with-font>* Live below your means and spend less than
