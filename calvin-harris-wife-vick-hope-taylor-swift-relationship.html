much about her relationships, that doesn't stop anyone from hoping to get some dirt. When looking back at the <a href=#>numerous songs that Swift has written</a>, everyone thinks that they can find clues and put the puzzle pieces together. When the star dated DJ, producer, and singer/songwriter Calvin Harris, she was super private. Just like <a href=#>fans think she wrote a song about Tom Hiddleston</a>, they are totally convinced that she penned "I Forgot That You Existed" about Harris... but this has never been confirmed.</p><p>Since Taylor Swift and Calvin Harris are both part of the <strong><a href=#>music</a> </strong>industry, their relationship seemed genuine and meant to last. Unfortunately, they broke up. But although Harris has moved on, people still talk about the former couple, especially since <strong>Harris' wife Vick Hope said she loves listening to Taylor Swift</strong>. In this article, we'll take a look at Hope's comments, <strong>whether Hope and Swift know each other</strong>, and what happened between Swift and Harris.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-was-taylor-swift-and-calvin-harris-39-wife-vick-hope-39-s-relationship-like-before-hope-said-she-was-a-fan>What Was Taylor Swift And Calvin Harris' Wife Vick Hope's Relationship Like Before Hope Said She Was A Fan?</h2><p>While Vick Hope admitted to loving Taylor Swift's music, <strong>Hope and Swift don't appear to have any relationship</strong>. It's unclear if they have ever met or if Swift and Calvin Harris are still in touch. Given Harris and Swift's busy music careers and the awkward circumstances of their breakup, it seems unlikely that they would still talk.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/calvin-harris-vick-hope.jpg><p>Since Hope said that she listens to Swift when her husband isn't around, it sounds like she thinks that Harris might be upset if he knew the truth. Any Taylor Swift fan would agree that it seems impossible not to love Swift's catchy beats, vulnerable and poetic lyrics, and inspiring place in the music industry. Of course, Hope probably loves <a href=#>Calvin Harris' popular songs</a> since so many of them are huge hits. But unlike <a href=#>Taylor Swift's most popular songs</a>, she can listen to those out in the open.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to People, Vick Hope hosts the BBC Radio 1 show Going Home with Vick, Katie and Jamie and admitted to loving Swift's music in an episode.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/untitled-design-2023-10-19t095022-884.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift's Parents’ Separation Deeply Affected Her Music And Career, Here's How">Taylor Swift's Parents’ Separation Deeply Affected Her Music And Career, Here's How</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's relationship with her dad and mom and their separation was the inspiration for some her best songs, including 'The Best Day'.</p><p>She said:</p><p>"As soon as my husband goes away, I listen to Taylor Swift.
