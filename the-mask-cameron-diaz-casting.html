But considering the unlikely circumstances behind the making of The Mask, we may have never been able to enjoy seeing Diaz in this part. Grounding this whimsical and particularly zany movie, in which Carrey's character of Stanley Ipkiss dons a mysterious mask to give him confidence-boosting magic powers that defy the laws of science, Diaz proved invaluable in cementing the emotional crux of the film as his love interest. In what would turn out to be the role that kickstarted her career, we're grateful that a fortuitous series of unlikely events led to Cameron Diaz's starring moment in The Mask.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/the-mask-poster.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>The Mask</h5>PG-13ComedyCrimeFantasyRomance<p class=display-card-description>Based on the comic series, The Mask is an action-comedy movie that stars Jim Carrey as Stanley Ipkiss, a mild-mannered bank teller with bad luck regarding life and women.

She had been in the industry from a relatively young age and was still attending high school whilst appearing in professional photo shoots – a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">high school that happened to be used in numerous films</a> including <a href=#><strong>The Craft</strong></a> and <strong>American Pie</strong>. Clearly, stardom was meant to be for Diaz, and her career as a model would turn out to be her lucky ticket to breaking into the movie industry, as well as predicting her status as a Hollywood bombshell.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Variety</a>, the casting director for The Mask <strong>Fern Champion</strong> had been considering numerous top models but hadn't found the right one for the part. Therefore, when her friend who worked in the same building suggested one particular model from her agency, Champion snapped up the opportunity. The model in question was Cameron Diaz, and Champion was struck by her "instant likeability" and obvious intelligence. If it weren't for this happy coincidence of working in the same building as a modeling agency, Diaz's talent may have never been spotted. Even the director of The Mask, <strong>Chuck Russell</strong>, initially had another modeling star in mind...</p><h2 id=an-iconic-39-90s-star-almost-landed-cameron-diaz-39-s-role-in-39-the-mask-39>An Iconic '90s Star Almost Landed Cameron Diaz's Role in 'The Mask'</h2><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The late <a href=#><strong>Anna Nicole Smith</strong></a>, known for being a television personality and model, was the initial front-runner for the role of Tina. The Mask director, Chuck Russell, had been strongly considering her for the role. However, according to the aforementioned Variety article, on meeting in person, he acknowledged that <strong>despite being very charming, she wasn't right for the part.</strong> On the other hand, when Russell first became aware of Diaz as a candidate after seeing her photo on the casting desk, he immediately asked for her to be brought in. After only her first reading, he was confident that she was perfect for the role, prompting his campaign to convince the producers that she was the right choice. After several callbacks which also served to highlight her chemistry with Carrey, it was a done deal – and the rest is history.</p><h2 id=cameron-diaz-has-been-wowing-in-films-ever-since-39-the-mask-39>Cameron Diaz Has Been Wowing in Films Ever Since 'The Mask'</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong><strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cameron Diaz's early modeling career clearly proved to be invaluable practice, because she is the embodiment of fresh-faced elegance in The Mask, in which she plays a singer who works undercover for her gangster boyfriend. Despite this description and the movie's early shots that feature Diaz in a stunning red dress, she's no ordinary femme fatale and instead opts to play the part with nuance. She is kind to the insecure character of Stanley, feeling endeared to the true self that he hides underneath his mask's persona, and bravely chooses to thwart her dangerous boyfriend's evil schemes. Diaz's performance is boosted by seamless chemistry with Carrey, as she was able to effortlessly balance his high-energy performance. By this time in his career, <a href=#>Jim Carrey already had the commercially successful, <strong>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective</strong></a> under his belt, establishing him as a comedic legend on the rise. With Diaz able to hold her own against him on screen, <strong>she instantly became a talent to watch</strong>. Beyond this, considering The Mask was her movie debut, her charismatic screen presence certainly set her up for the career she would go on to have.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tumblr_866dd0ce10aca800b0fdc9079e6e01fd_36e0674d_1280.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The 10 Best Cameron Diaz Movies, Ranked by Rotten Tomatoes ">The 10 Best Cameron Diaz Movies, Ranked by Rotten Tomatoes</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>"Good morning, Charlie!"</p><p>With Hollywood being a beacon for the attractive and talented, it comes as no surprise to hear that Diaz's story is not singular. For instance, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Jason Statham was still working as a model</a> when he was cast in <strong>Guy Ritchie</strong>'s <strong>Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels</strong>; <strong>Matthew McConaughey</strong> was cast after a chance meeting with<strong> Dazed and Confused</strong>'s casting director; and <strong>Shelley Duvall</strong> was cast in her first movie role, <strong>Brewster McCloud</strong>, after meeting the director, <strong>Robert Altman</strong>, by chance at a party.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Diaz's first time on screen, and transitioning from another career, could have been one-note and a straightforward foil, the actress was able to play the character with nuance, charisma, and allure. It is exactly this balance of allure, bubbly sweetness, and intelligent gumption that Diaz displays in later roles including those in <a href=#><strong>There's Something About Mary</strong></a>, <strong>Charlie's Angels</strong>, and even as Princess Fiona in <a href=#><strong>Shrek</strong></a>. If it weren't for the lucky events that led to her role in The Mask, we may have never been able to enjoy Diaz in these other iconic films. Let's hope she stays <a href=#>out of retirement</a> for long enough to continue adding to her unforgettable filmography.</p><p>The Mask is currently available to stream on Hulu in the U.S.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">WATCH ON HULU</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51kwamxjKaYrKNdmK6usdGopWacmZbHbq%2FArKuippdk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./elodie-grace-orkin-net-worth-changed-after-playing-angela-on-stranger-things.html>&#171;&nbsp;Elodie Grace Orkin Net Worth May Have Changed After Playing Angela On Stranger Things For Netflix</a>
