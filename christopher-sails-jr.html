Both of his parents owned a couple of YouTube channels but sadly, they are not together now and their channels also have been deleted. He is the only child of the ex-couple. Other than this, not much about his other family members have come forward. Chris is just 4 years old now so, we don’t think he would be attending any school at this early age.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-18806 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Christopher-Sails-Jr.-Parents.jpeg alt="Christopher Sails Jr. Parents" width=650 height=620 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-18806 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Christopher Sails Jr. with his mom and ad (Source: Naibuzz)</p><h2><span id=Professional_Life>Professional Life</span></h2><p>Christopher Sails Sr. and Queen Naija joined YouTube soon after the birth of Chris.

His parents never miss the chance and are always ready to film special moments of Chris which they post on their channel.</p><p>Christopher has posted many prank videos that he has done on his son.

Chris also got his ear pierced during their vacation. Surprisingly, he didn’t cry throughout the video. Moreover, it seemed like he enjoyed the experience.</p><p>Christopher and Queen often post cute pictures of their son on their respective Instagram account. It is a fact that Chris became popular because of his parent’s YouTube channel but it is also a known fact that their channel grew and gained more fans thanks to their son Chris.</p><p>Christopher and Queen have divorced and their YouTube channel is not available now.
