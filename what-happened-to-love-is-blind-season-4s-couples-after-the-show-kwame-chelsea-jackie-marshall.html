While some proved that love is truly blind, others proved that this season was definitely one of the most dramatic. Proposals were made, couples were reshuffled and "I do"— as well as "I don't"— was said at the altar. But which couples fit where? Here's what happened to the Love Is Blind Season 4's Couples after the show.</p><h2 id=where-are-brett-brown-and-tiffany-pennywell-after-the-show><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Where Are Brett Brown And Tiffany Pennywell After The Show?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/img_9855.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If there was one couple that restored faith in the entire process of the series, it was Brett and Tiffany. The pair actually made it to the altar and said their long-awaited "I do" by the end of the season. At the altar, Brett had shared that Tiffany was always "the one" he wanted to marry since connecting with her in the pods.</p><p>Tiffany shared with ET, that married life post the show is everything she could ever want. "He's come back to Houston with me and my entire family, they just call him, 'Yo, handsome husband!' He definitely is handsome. I think they just love how he treats me too," Tiffany explained.</p><p>Tiffany also revealed that she has since moved to Portland, Oregon, to be with her man— who is a talented photographer.</p><p>"I moved to Portland. It's been easy just kind of picking up and settling into Portland only because I'm more of a free spirit," she said. "Other than the closet space, we've been good. I've learned to accept his gadgets in the household, actually I've come to appreciate them."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Love Is Blind Season 4 Cast's Real-Life Jobs</a></span></p><h2 id=what-happened-to-paul-peden-and-micah-lussier-after-the-show><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>What Happened To Paul Peden and Micah Lussier After The Show?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/untitled-design-28.jpg><p>It's hard to believe that— even after a "failed propsoal"— queen of drama Micah Lussier was almost too invested in her old flame Kwame Appiah over her actual fiancé, Paul Peden. But fans had some faith when the duo actually made it to the altar together— but, all was not as well as it may have seemed. Once at the ceremony, Micah opted to let Paul answer first when asked if she wanted to marry him. Lussier told PEOPLE there was a reason for that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I think as a viewer, it might seem like I was afraid of saying yes and him saying no. It was actually quite the opposite," she said. "I felt like if I said yes, he might feel like he had to and like he was backed in a corner. And I wanted him to answer for him."</p><p>Paul then declined to marry her. “I love you, but I don't think that we can choose each other right now,” he said. “I think that we're not there.” His decision sent an upset Micah running away from the altar after which her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"mean girl" friend Shelby</a>, comforted her.</p><p>During the <a href=#>delayed reunion special</a> on April 16, the pair confirmed they continued to date after the series, but that “it ended pretty quickly after” Paul visited her in Arizona.</p><p>"We decided that we were going to try, and we eventually did try," Micah told ET. "At that point, we were doing long distance and what was really hard about that was that the foundation was such a mess."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-between-marshall-glaze-and-jackie-bonds-after-the-show><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>What Happened Between Marshall Glaze and Jackie Bonds After The Show?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/love-is-blind-season-4-marshall-and-jackie.jpg><p>In a shocking twist of the season, couple <a href=#>Marshall and Jackie's relationship ended before they even got the altar</a>. Instead, Jackie began a relationship with former pod-interest Josh Demas after reconnecting on a coffee date. During the reunion, Jackie cleared up things about the timeline of her relationship with Josh, as the series seemed to depict her as a cheater.</p><p>"Okay, so I broke up with Marshall before I saw Josh at the coffee shop. It looks like I'm a cheater, and I am not a cheater," she explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Marshall admitted during the live portion that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he connected with castmate Kacia Clark</a>, though it hadn't worked out, as he was not completely over his break-up with Jackie. Later on in the pre-recorded reunion interview, Vanessa asked Jackie what caused her to break things off with Marshall.</p><p>"It happened off-camera when we were filling out the marriage certificate," Jackie said. "He had called me a derogatory name, and we fought about it, and he left for three days. I think what it was a bad joke. It was one of those where we were joking, but it just came off as bad."</p><p>It was eventually clarified that Glaze had allegedly called her a transphobic slur, to which Glaze denied. News of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jackie's alleged leaked text messages</a> between her and her friends also surfaced, wherein Marshall's sexuality was discussed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I felt like it was my turn to make a jab. I said, ‘You know, you got a strong jawline. You coulda been a man for all I know,'” Marshall said. “She took very clear offense to it. We were just learning each other. We don’t really know what each other’s triggers are. I thought it was a safe space because she’s coming at me, calling me out for my sexual preferences… I did not say a specific term. I did not use a derogatory word, no.”</p><p>Despite the drama between him, Jackie and Josh—<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Marshall still wants for all three of them to "move on from this."</a></p><p>"There's a lot that's going into this, and I'm just going to direct this to the public. At this point, this is not about Jackie and Marshall anymore. Let that be bygones," he added. "Let them move on, let me move on and just forget it. Jackie and Josh are happy. She's happy. I'm happy.

"I'm happy with the way it's progressing. If this is meant to be for the rest of our lives, then I'm OK with the wait and patience."</p><p>Kwame also shared that he moved from Portland, Oregon to Seattle to be with his wife, saying, "Since transitioning to Seattle, I've definitely found a lot of love for it. I love this place, and I don't think that the next transition in my life would be happier in any other place."</p><p>As for Chelsea, she's called married life post filming "real."</p><p>"Marriage is not easy, but doing it at the pace that we've had to do it has been extra difficult... we moved in together the day after we got married," Chelsea said.

The two called off their engagement at their end of their vacation in Mexico. The decision promoted Zack to reconnect with former flame, Bliss Poureetezadi who—though skeptical at first— eventually began dating him. The pair wed at the end of the season, despite skepticism from Poureetezadi's father.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the reunion, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zack roasted Irina over her behavior throughout the season</a> telling her she did many things that hurt people, claiming viewers only saw “10% of it.” While he said he forgives her, he added, “If we’re real, you went on this show to get famous.”</p><p>In an effort to clear her name Irina cited metal illness as the driving force behind her questionable behavior, to which Bliss seemed to have little patience for. She even shared that Irina's messages to her revealed that she was far from a saint when it came to meddling with Zack and her relationship.</p><p>"You did tell me when you landed in Mexico that I dodged a bullet while you also texted him, ‘I’m so sorry, let’s talk. I hope something happens with you and Bliss.’ I think you can have panic attacks, and you can have trouble with mental illness and all of that. That’s totally valid. But then you’re turning around, and you’re doing malicious things, and you’re acting in really cruel ways. It’s hard to reconcile those two things,” Bliss said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since the end of Love Is Blind season 4, Zack and Bliss' marriage has been, well, bliss.
