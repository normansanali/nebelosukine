De Armas told the audience of Saturday Night Live that the actor's surprise visit was "such a kind gesture."</p><p>The actress, who had recently earned her first Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Marilyn Monroe in <a href=#>Netflix’s controversial Blonde</a>, called 2023 a “magical year.”</p><p>Ana de Armas said her father would be “so proud of me, and he would be proud to see me today standing on this stage.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ana-de-armas-boyfriend-paul-boukadakis-is-hidden-from-the-spotlight-following-her-public-relationship-with-ben-affleck.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Ana De Armas Boyfriend Paul Boukadakis Is Hidden From The Spotlight Following Her Public Relationship With Ben Affleck</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Ana de Armas found solace and privacy with her current boyfriend, Paul Boukadakis, more than when she was with Ben Affleck.</span><h2 id=what-is-ana-de-armas-39-relationship-with-robert-de-niro>What Is Ana De Armas' Relationship With Robert De Niro?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/robert-de-niro-ana-de-armas-attending-hands-of-stone-photocall.jpg><p>Ana De Armas met Robert De Niro when working on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hands of Stone, one of her first American movies</a>. The film told the story of Panamanian former professional boxer Roberto Durán. De Niro plays Durán's trainer, Ray Arcel, while de Armas stars as Durán's wife, Felicidad Iglesias.</p><p>Her appearance on Saturday Night Live came during an important year for the Cuban-born actress. "Not only was I nominated for an Oscar, but in three weeks, I’m going to officially become an American citizen!” Ana de Armas excitedly told audiences in her opening monologue. “I am proud to become a citizen because when I moved here, everyone was so welcoming.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When talking about the Goodfellas star, she added, “I’ve been so fortunate to work with so many supportive actors.”</p><h2 id=ana-de-armas-journey-coming-to-america-from-cuba>Ana De Armas Journey Coming To America From Cuba</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/depositphotos_110070032_xl-1.jpg><p>Ana De Armas moved to the USA from Cuba when she was in her 20s. She was raised in Havana, where she <a href=#>studied her craft </a>and started her acting career. Her parents hugely supported her career and helped encourage her to become an actress as a child.</p><p>“In Cuba, you live in a bubble. I didn’t know what the world was like. I had never traveled before in my life.”</p><p>She soon moved to Spain to pursue her career and make connections. Despite having <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">only 300 Euros to her name</a>, she soon landed her role on television. This led her to being cast in Hand of Stone alongside Robert De Niro.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Everything-We-Know-About-Ana-De-Armas’-Role-In-John-Wick-Spin-off.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Cuba's National Theater School Turned Ana De Armas Away When She Tried To Return</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Ana De Armas' decision to act on Spanish TV proved costly for her theater school training in Cuba.</span><p>While most people hate the feeling of starting over as an actress in a new country, de Armas thrived on it.

Despite his on-screen persona, he is much softer behind the camera. He is always happy to impart his wisdom to others and help young stars with their craft.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking about what generations can learn from each other, The Godfather star said, “There’s no downside in asking somebody who’s been around a lot longer than you, especially if they’ve done things that you’ve done, or in that area.”</p><p>He expressed his love for passing on advice to the younger generation, “Some people do, and I like giving advice. Some young actor friends of mine will ask me for advice and I like to do it. I appreciate it. They listen, and they take what they want, what they can use, like I do.”</p><p>Bradley Cooper has praised De Niro's advice and explained that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the advice he gave to him at graduate school </a>changed his life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I remember he came to my graduate school, and I asked him a question," he explained. "It was like a beam of light shot through my stomach when he looked at me, and I used that as fuel for years when I would put myself on the line for something. When I get rejected or turned down over and over, I’d think about the reception I got from Robert De Niro that day and keep going.”</p><p>De Niro and Cooper have now formed a friendship after appearing in numerous films with each other. “I like to give advice to younger actors or anybody who wants it…I love to give advice to my children but they are at an age where they don’t usually want to listen. But…Bradley listens.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipqJqVp8FusMRmpaKqn2LDqr%2FIrapmmZ6WeqWxjJqpppmjYrOiwMeeqWaqlaGutbXOp6qhoaBitaK6w6xkqJ5dqMGwusRo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./chloe-frances-cockburn.html>&#171;&nbsp;Chloe Frances Cockburn - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Married, Facts</a>
