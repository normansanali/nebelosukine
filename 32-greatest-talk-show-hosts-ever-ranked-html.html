Leno’s fans point to his endurance (22 years!) and popularity, but ask them to name a great show or moment and their eyes go blank.

Rivers first appeared on<i> The Tonight Show </i>in 1965; throughout the ‘70s and ‘80s, she regularly sat in for a vacationing Johnny before being promoted by the famously volatile Carson as an official guest-host in 1983. Rivers’s stand-up tagline was, “Can we talk?”<span> </span>and she was a enthusiastic interviewer with a big New Yawk yap, happy to play the fool to make her guests look their best. In 1986, when the burgeoning Fox network gave her <i>The Late Show With Joan Rivers</i>,&nbsp;competing directly against Carson (after NBC failed to consider her a suitable successor to him), Rivers became the first female late-night talk-show host. But with low ratings and a strained relationship between Rivers and Fox executives over the show’s eccentric direction, she was fired after just one year. Arsenio Hall would take over her role after a string of zany guest-hosts, and from ’89 to ’93, Rivers would try her hand at daytime hosting. Meanwhile, Carson never spoke to Rivers again, a knife-plunge that haunted her for the rest of her life. When her husband Edgar committed suicide in 1987, Carson did not contact her. “It was like Stalin had sent me to Siberia,” she told <i><a href=#>People</a></i>. Despite Rivers breaking the glass ceiling nearly 30 years ago, late-night TV remains as much of a boys<span>&nbsp;</span>club today as it was during Carson’s martinis-and-strip-steak prime, and Rivers remains the only woman ever to host a network late-night talk show.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-41dfb38112c89533d13420861e66a711-15-0-0@published data-word-count=3><b><span>28.

With non sequiturs, outward hostility, and absurdist interludes, <i>Space Ghost Coast to Coast</i> mocked every talk show that preceded it, and the mesmerizing show’s cult success on Cartoon Network, where it debuted in 1994, led to the creation of the late-night Adult Swim block. The show’s appeal, aside from meta comedy (“Can you say ‘bang a dog up the ass’<span> </span>on TV?”<span> </span>Space Ghost asks), was the sense that he was the only host who told the truth. “See you at the auto show,”<span> </span>he barked dismissively at Adam West, the has-been actor who played Batman in the ‘60s, something every host has surely fantasized about saying.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-41dfb38112c89533d13420861e66a711-18-0-0@published data-word-count=3><span><b>27.</b> <b>Mike Douglas</b></span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-41dfb38112c89533d13420861e66a711-20-0-0@published data-word-count=179><span>He always understood the appeal of his show: “I’m a square,”<span> </span>Douglas said.

O’Brien was jumpy and overeager, and when ratings dropped, the network fired him, only to realize they didn’t have anyone to take his place. David Letterman visited the show and gave it his imprimatur, and ratings slowly rose. O’Brien’s plan was to stage a traditional talk-show, but with all the elements twisted; hence, the Masturbating Bear, Pimpbot, and, uh, Andy Richter. Eventually, his ratings were good enough that NBC promised him the network’s prize job, hosting <i>The Tonight Show</i>.

Today, with more late-night options and dwindling big-three-network audiences, celebrities no longer have to genuflect before talk-show hosts as they did to Sanders, but Shandling’s skewering of showbiz narcissism and insecurity remain eternal.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-41dfb38112c89533d13420861e66a711-81-0-0@published data-word-count=3><span><b>6.</b> <b>Oprah Winfrey</b></span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-41dfb38112c89533d13420861e66a711-83-0-0@published data-word-count=4><span>Oprah by the numbers:</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-41dfb38112c89533d13420861e66a711-84-0-0@published data-word-count=138><span><strong>Years <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show</i> aired:</strong> 25 (1986–2011)</span><br><span></span><span><strong>Average number of weekly viewers:</strong> 40 million</span><br><span></span><span><strong>Number of pounds of fat she rolled out in a red wagon, equal to the weight she lost on the liquid Optifast diet, in 1988:</strong> 67</span><br><span></span><span><strong>Number of Pontiac G6 automobiles given away to audience members during 2004’s season premiere:</strong> 276 (“You get a car!

He’s still neurotic, thankfully (and reliably funny), but the bitterness has subsided, mostly due to the enormous success of his podcast, and the narcissism has given way to a profound curiosity about and empathy for the inner lives of artists: fellow comedians, as well as actors, directors, and musicians (recent guests run from Brillo-headed nonagenarian comic Marty Allen to alt-comedy nerd Barack Obama). No one gets more out of his guests than Maron, whose now-familiar emotional touchstones<span> </span>—<span> </span>family background as class determinant, art as the pursuit of truth, self-acceptance and forgiveness<span> </span>—<span> </span>give every interview a sweetness and depth without equal. </span><a href=#><span>Slate</span></a><span> ranked the 25 greatest podcast episodes of all time; Maron’s two-plus-hour talk with frenemy Louis C.K., who broke down and cried while talking about the birth of his daughter, was the no-brainer choice for No. 1.

Comedy Central didn’t want to lose Craig Kilborn, the original host of <i>The Daily Show</i>, and after CBS lured Kilborn away with network-size money in 1999, the cable channel sued him for breach of contract. Then they turned to Jon Stewart, who’d had more success as a fake replacement talk-show host on <i>The Larry Sanders Show</i> than he’d had hosting an actual talk show for about 18 months in the mid-’90s, mostly on MTV. Turned out Stewart was way funnier when he wasn’t pretending to care about Blind Melon or Bronson Pinchot. Starting with “Indecision 2000,”<span> </span>the former stand-up comic exposed what Tom Brokaw calls the “absurdities, hypocrisies, [and] juvenilia”<span> </span>of the political charade. <i>Satire </i>was too weak a word<span> </span>— when Stewart attacked targets small (Chris Wallace) or big (Douglas Feith), there was an actual punch to his punch lines. Stewart’s “fake news”<span> </span>show offered more analysis and courage than any other TV program, and with his array of blank stares, double takes, and openmouthed, bug-eyed outrage, he became the Meryl Streep of reaction shots.

With his Malibu tan and Burbank wisecracks, Carson did more than anyone else to make L.A. a brand.

Then came a timeline of <i>what the hell?</i> moments, commemorated on YouTube: Crispin Glover, Oliver Reed, Drew Barrymore, Madonna, Cher (who called him an asshole), John McCain in absentia, Joaquin Phoenix, Farrah Fawcett.

Megyn Kelly discussed her husband’s dick size. Billy Joel reminisced about doing heroin. For over 30 years, Howard Stern’s calling and gift has been getting his guests, many wildly famous, to talk freely about all the things they’d rather not talk about. Of course there’s sex<span> </span>—<span> </span>so much sex<span> </span>—<span> </span>but there’s also drugs and money,<span>&nbsp;</span>which, for most celebrities, are far more taboo,<span>&nbsp;</span>and marriage and work anxiety and family and vanity. If there’s one theme running through the thousands upon thousands of interviews Stern has conducted, it’s that he hates a phony. Sometimes that can be a limited, teenaged lens through which to view the world, but Stern’s bullshit detector is what his fans love most about him, and his own neuroses and discomfort more than balance out the self-righteousness. “In real life,”<span> </span>Stern </span><a href=#><span>says</span></a><span>, “I barely know how to socialize,”<span> </span>and his forays into TV and movies have largely been busts.
