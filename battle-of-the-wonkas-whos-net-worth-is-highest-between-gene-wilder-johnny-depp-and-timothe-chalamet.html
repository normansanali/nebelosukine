Wilder passed away in 2016, but his legacy will live on forever. Despite Tim Burton's version having more popular actors, the original is the most popular amongst fans. Even though there were sequels to the novels, a sequel movie was never made.</p><p>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was based off the 1964 novel "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" by Ronald Dahl. The movie <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">inspired the creation of the Wonka Bar,</a> alongside the Everlasting Gobstopper and the Scrumdiddlyumptious Bar.</p><p>Despite the actors all playing Willy Wonka, they all had vastly different careers.

He starred in many films and TV shows including Bonnie and Clyde, The Producers, Death of a Salesman, The DuPont Show Of The Week and more. Before those roles he was a stage actor. Once Wilder starred in Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory, his career skyrocketed. The Academy Award nominated actor acted until 2003. You might have seen him in Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles, See No Evil, Hear No Evil or the other numerous credits he did.</p><p>His last role was a guest spot on Will & Grace in 2003, for which he won an Emmy Award. After that guest role, Wilder turned to writing. He went on to write a memoir, a collection of stories and novels.</p><h2 id=wilder-as-wonka><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Wilder As Wonka</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor auditioned for Mel Stuart's film adaption of Dahl's novel. After reciting some lines, the director immediately offered him the role. However, before Wilder, other actors, like Fred Astaire, Joel Grey, Ron Moody, and Jon Pertwee were all considered. Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory was not a commercial success on it's opening weekend, but critics gave it positive reviews. The movie went on to earn a gross box office earning of over $4 million. Today, the film is still very popular and part of that might be due to how Wilder played the role.</p><h2 id=gene-wilder-39-s-net-worth-at-the-time-of-his-death><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Gene Wilder's Net Worth At The Time Of His Death</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sadly, Gene Wilder passed away at the age of 83 on August 29, 2016 from complications of Alzheimer's disease, which was kept private from fans until after his death.

Wilder never had any children, so when he died his fortune was transferred to his wife and his nephew, Jordan Walker-Pearlman, who became the family spokesperson.</p><p>Wilder also had a property in Connecticut worth $1 million and a home in Bel Air, which he bought for $2.75 million. <a href=#>The actor sold his house in 2013 to Elon Musk for $6.75 million</a>.
