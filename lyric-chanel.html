Finally, on March 5, 2021, early in the morning, Lyric Chanel breathed her last breath in a hospital bed.</p><p>Beyonce, who first met Lyric after sending her flowers in September 2020, remained in love with her even after she died. She put together a video montage on her YouTube channel that included all of Lyric’s smiling, singing, and dancing videos, as well as her singing in the background. Beyonce began the song with “Brown Skin Girl,” then moved on to “Halo,” and finally ended it with “Love on Top.”</p><h2><span id=Chanel8217s_Cancer_Journey_Lyric>Chanel’s Cancer Journey Lyric</span></h2><p>Lyric Chanel’s parents learned the devastating news on November 27, 2020, during a follow-up appointment for her September 10th brain surgery. According to reports, Dr. David Sandberg removed enough of the tumor, but it grew back over the course of two months in a larger capacity of her brain.</p><p>Unfortunately, the doctors were powerless to intervene. No chemotherapy drug could treat Lyric’s Anaplastic Ependymoma tumor, and her life expectancy was one year at the time.</p><p>Lyric’s condition meant that her parents didn’t have enough time to work. The family was in shambles at the time, living in a hotel. As a result, a fundraiser was organized by Si’Asia Davenport, who referred to Lyric’s mother as her sister. By the time Lyric died, the GoFundMe page “For the Love of Lyric & Family” had raised over $196 thousand.</p><p>Asia Davenport revealed that her children, Lyric, and her siblings would frequently play together.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>influencer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Astrid Wett Sexuality And Gender: Is She Lesbian?
