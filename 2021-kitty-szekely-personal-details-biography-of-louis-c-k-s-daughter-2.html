Having won several awards most notably; Emmy, Peabody, and the Grammy Awards for his numerous talents, it’s logical to see why his daughter Kitty Szekely is a star in her own right. Although she is not in the business of entertainment like her father, her budding popularity is a testament to her dad’s iconic status. Keep reading to broaden your knowledge about this Kitty, her early life and several other interesting facts.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kitty-szekelys-personal-details></span><strong>Kitty Szekely’s Personal Details</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Katherine Szekely popularly known as Kitty Szekely was born in 2002 to her parents, Louise C.K and Alix Bailey. Her father is a reputable figure in the world of comedy while her mother is a very skilled painter. She is of Hungarian-Mexican ethnicity and American nationality.</p><p>Until recently, there was no information relating to the exact date of birth and birthplace of Kitty Szekely, owing to the fact that her parents decided to shield her from the spotlight so she can get to experience life like a regular American kid. Anyway, it is now known that she was born in 2002 on the 22nd of March. About her educational qualifications, Kitty is currently in high school; however, the name of the school she attends is one of the things we would one day love to know about her.</p><p>At the age of six, young Kitty was dealt with a harsh blow of reality as her parents decided to get divorced, a decision that changed her life drastically for reasons that are not far-fetched. Upon finalizing their divorce, the duty and burden of raising Kitty fell solely on her mother who lived in Lowell, Massachusetts. Her dad, on the other hand, provided the financial support required.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=her-career></span><strong>Her Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although very little is known as regards the life of Kitty Szekely, it is pretty much an open secret that she shares her mothers passion for painting, thus prompting speculations that she may one day decide to follow the footstep of her mother who holds a bachelors degree in Fine Art from Bennington College, as well as a Masters degree from Indiana University.</p><p>Several sources claim that she has a huge sense of humor and even though we can’t vouch for the authenticity of such reports, it doesn’t sound far-fetched as she is her father’s daughter anyway. Being a teenager, it is clear that Kitty Szekely still has her future way ahead of her, but with proper education and her parent’s guidance and support, it is safe to assume that she would get to build a fine career for herself.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=facts-about-louis-cks-daughter-kitty-szekely></span><strong>Facts About Louis C.K.’s Daughter, Kitty Szekely</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>What we have below are facts you need to keep to mind about Kitty, the daughter of the famous comedian and actor Louis C.K</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=1-her-siblings></span><strong>1.
