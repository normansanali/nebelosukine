Where are his relatives?</span></h2><p>The CEO and co-founder of Creative Technology, Sim Wong Hoo, was wed to Karen Ngui for more than ten years. Since Karen Ngui prefers to maintain a low profile and avoid the spotlight, not much is known about her.</p><p>Son and daughter were born to Sim Wong Hoo and Karen Ngui. It must be made clear what their names are and what they do for a living.</p><p>Sim Wong Hoo was reserved and rarely discussed his personal life in public.</p><p>He was well-known for his work at Creative Technology and for his contributions to the computer sector, but he hardly ever discussed his family or his private life.</p><p>At the age of 67, Sim Wong Hoo passed away on January 4, 2023.

He had wealth from the Company as well as assets in real estate and other industries.</p><p>He was a private man who rarely disclosed his wealth or financial situation to the public. Based on the success and scale of Creative Technology as well as his personal assets and investments, his net worth was calculated.</p><h2><span id=After_Sim_Wong_Hoo8217s_passing_the_price_of_creative_shares_increased>After Sim Wong Hoo’s passing, the price of creative shares increased.</span></h2><p>As was already established, Sim Wong Hoo, a deceased inventor, served as Creative Technology’s CEO. He gave his entire being to the business and constantly put the interests of the organization first.</p><p>Unfortunately, due to their biological makeup, humans are unable to escape the grip of impending death. Sim died quietly not long ago as well.</p><p>While the entire world was in shock and mourning Hoo’s passing, the share price of Creative Technology rose by approximately 25%. On January 5, 2023, the shares of the international technology corporation was valued at S$1.76.</p><p>This sum was only attained by the company’s share price in September 2022. Following the abrupt and tragic death of its co-founder, it immediately rose.</p><p>IG International market expert Yeap Jun Rong responded to the stock price increase by speculating that it might be because the late Wong Hoo was the primary controlling shareholder of Creative Technology.</p><p>Rong continued by saying that Sim’s passing might have led to speculation that his ownership interest was being sold. People may have then realized the share’s true value as a result of it.</p><p>He also advanced the theory that market players would be anticipating any new succession plan from the incoming leadership, which might include growth measures to support investor confidence.</p><p>Sim Wong Hoo’s business was voluntarily delisted from the Nasdaq stock market in 2000 after being listed there in 1992. It peaked in 2000 when its shares reached a high of over S$60 on the SGX.</p><p>After losing the MP3 market to Apple’s iPod in the early 2000s, the tech company’s fortunes suffered. After introducing its brand-new Super X-Fi technology, which could produce a multi-dimensional sound experience in headsets, it recently gained media attention.</p><p>Regrettably, the company lost $11 million in 2022. Given the recent increase in its stock price, it is expected that Creative Technology will recover and soon start experiencing more success.</p><p>It will be intriguing to observe who fills Sim’s vacant CEO job and how the new administration functions going forward.</p><h3><span id=Also_Read_Simon_Sinek_Motivating_Speech_On_Wife_Relationship><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Simon Sinek Motivating Speech On Wife, Relationship"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1086337,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/simon-sinek-motivating-speech-on-wife-relationship/"}{"1":62}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Simon Sinek Motivating Speech On Wife, Relationship</a></span></span></h3><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Founder Of Creative Technology</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Is Les Ferdinand Related To Rio Ferdinand | Family Tree</a></h3>Given their similar surnames and exceptional football skills, one could wonder if Les and Rio Ferdinand are related.Former English professional football player Les Ferdinand was a formidable strik <a href=# class=vmagazine-lite-related-more>Read More</a> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Troy Aikman | Wife And Family</a></h3>Troy is a former American football quarterback who competed with the National Football League's Dallas Cowboys.
