So, here are 10 actor and actress pairings that are seriously picture perfect.</p><h2 id=austin-butler-amp-chord-overstreet><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Austin Butler & Chord Overstreet</span></h2><p>These two blonde and blue-eyed heartthrobs are definitely both making everyone swoon, and it's probably because they look super similar. The&nbsp;Glee&nbsp;actor and <a href=#>this up and coming actor</a> who appeared in Tarantino's newest flick are definitely making people look twice.</p><p>If fans are scratching their heads trying to remember which one is which, Overstreet is the one who has thus far sung on the small screen, but Butler is up to be Elvis in a new biopic, so. Also, Butler has gone to dark hair - thankfully.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mila-kunis-amp-sarah-hyland><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Mila Kunis & Sarah Hyland</span></h2><p>Hyland is most famous for her role on&nbsp;Modern Family,&nbsp;while Kunis first made it big on&nbsp;That '70s Show&nbsp;before she hit the big screen for flicks like&nbsp;Ted&nbsp;and&nbsp;Friends With Benefits.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Mila Kunis & Ashton Kutcher: 15 Facts About Their Biggest Roles</a></span></p><p>These two finally met back in 2010, and actually pretended to be each other!

Thankfully, one usually sticks to television, and one usually sticks to film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amy-adams-amp-isla-fisher><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Amy Adams & Isla Fisher</span></h2><p>These two red-heads are both known for their striking hair color and stunning faces, and they're both talented and versatile actresses. It's not news to either of them, and they've both poked fun at how alike they look - and how often they get mistaken for the other.</p><p>In fact, they were both cast in&nbsp;Nocturnal Animals,&nbsp;where Amy Adams' character reads a novel written by her ex-husband (<a href=#>Jake Gyllenhaal</a>), who creates a revenge thriller - and Fisher plays Adams' counterpart in the 'fantasy' world. It was perfect, really.</p><h2 id=dax-shepard-amp-zach-braff><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Dax Shepard & Zach Braff</span></h2><p>This one might not be obvious until fans actually take a second to look at them side-by-side. They're both similar ages, and both have been in the business for quite some time. They have the same nose and the same adorable crooked smile - and it's actually kind of weird.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Kristen Bell And Dax Shepard: What We Know About Them As A Couple</a></span></p><p>Apparently, Kristen Bell (Shepard's wife) did a face-swap with them, and she even couldn't tell her husband from the other.

They were both huge stars in the 1990s, and that probably made it even harder for fans to actually keep them straight.</p><p><a href=#>Demi Moore</a> is definitely known for some pretty intense dramas and thrillers, but Jennifer Connelly has also taken on similar roles. The only saving grace fans might have is the eight-year age difference between these two bombshells.</p><h2 id=mark-wahlberg-amp-matt-damon><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Mark Wahlberg & Matt Damon</span></h2><p>For huge fans of film, these two have definitely been sorted out, and those that are big enough fans would never confuse one with the other. However, when these two were peaking in the '90s and 2000s, they were definitely one of the most famously mixed-up pairs.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Times Matt Damon & Ben Affleck's Bromance Had Us Dying Of Laughter</a></span></p><p>They've discussed it together, and they actually both starred in Martin Scorsese's thriller&nbsp;The Departed.&nbsp;Honestly, there are worst actors to get mixed up with.

Jessica Chastain and Bryce Dallas Howard have both in the business for years, but they're still confused for each other all the time.</p><p>Apparently, they often also go with it with fans mix them up, and they also shared the screen together for&nbsp;The Help.&nbsp;That must have been confusing for all fans watching!</p><h2 id=jeff-bridges-amp-kurt-russell><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jeff Bridges & Kurt Russell</span></h2><p>These two are both legends in the industry and have been for quite some time. However, for all those young movie lovers out there, it might be hard to get a grasp on these icons as they keep appearing in newer flicks.</p><p>Bridges has his fair share of Oscar nominations from action flicks and dramas from the '70s to the 2010s, while Russell has also been a prominent face in <a href=#>the action genre</a>. Plus, they're only two years apart!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=thandie-newton-amp-zoe-saldana><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Thandie Newton & Zoe Saldana</span></h2><p>These two popular and lovable actresses definitely show some resemblance, and they've both stated that they get mistaken for the other - a lot.
