Did they meet and immediately fall in love, or have they actually known each other for a while before they started dating? Keep on scrolling to find out!</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-started-dating-around-october-2016>Taylor Swift And Joe Alwyn Started Dating Around October 2016</h2><p>On October 12, 2016, Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn attended the same Kings of Leon concert, which is why many believe that this was the beginning of their relationship. However, no one suspected anything at the time, and even though Swift and her friends attended the premiere of Alwyn’s movie, Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk, the two were still not being linked to each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, it wasn't until May 2017 that the two were first suspected to be a couple — which is almost nine months after the Kings of Leon concert. In June 2017, the two were caught together by the paparazzi for the first time, and the rest is pretty much history.</p><p>Unlike Taylor Swift's previous relationships, this time around the singer and her partner decided to keep things more private. While the two aren't hiding their relationship, they are also rarely talking about it — but when they do, it's clear that they are very happy. In an interview with The Guardian, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift revealed why she doesn't speak about her relationship</a>:</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Does Joe Alwyn Have The Lowest Net Worth Of All Taylor Swift's Boyfriends?">Does Joe Alwyn Have The Lowest Net Worth Of All Taylor Swift's Boyfriends?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I’ve learned that if I do, people think it’s up for discussion, and our relationship isn’t up for discussion. If you and I were having a glass of wine right now, we’d be talking about it — but it’s just that it goes out into the world. That’s where the boundary is, and that’s where my life has become manageable. I really want to keep it feeling manageable."</p><p>In an interview with British Vogue, Joe Alwyn confirmed that the two know that fans are interested in their relationship, but they choose to keep it private regardless. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The actor said</a> "I’m aware people want to know about that side of things. I think we have been successfully very private, and that has now sunk in for people."</p><p>Considering that the two have been together for over half a decade, it certainly seems as if this approach is working well for them. However, everyone knows that Taylor Swift frequently writes about her love life, which is why fans did in a way get to know more about her relationship through the albums she released after she started dating Alwyn — Reputation (2017), Lover (2019), Folklore (2020), and Evermore (2020).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-reportedly-met-at-the-2016-met-gala>Taylor Swift And Joe Alwyn Reportedly Met At The 2016 Met Gala</h2><p>While many believe that Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn started dating in October 2016, the two actually met before that. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Both stars attended the 2016 Met Gala in May</a>, which was almost five months before the Kings of Leon concert.</p><p>In fact, many believe that a part of the song "Dress" from Swift’s 2017 album Reputation is hinting at this meeting. In particular, the lyric “flashback to when you met me, your buzzed cut and my hair bleached.” As fans know, Swift attended the 2016 Met Gala rocking bleached hair which means this could be the night she is referring to.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Taylor Swift’s Beau Joe Alwyn Stars In ‘Conversations With Friends’ On Hulu">Taylor Swift’s Beau Joe Alwyn Stars In ‘Conversations With Friends’ On Hulu</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, at the time Taylor Swift was dating Scottish DJ Calvin Harris, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">soon after the Met Gala the two broke up</a>. After Harris, Swift quickly moved on to actor Tom Hiddleston whom she dated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in the summer of 2016</a>. This means that even though Swift and Alwyn potentially met at the Met Gala, sparks didn't immediately fly and Swift moved on to dating someone else before ending up with Joe Alwyn.</p><p>While Swift and Alwyn did attend the Met Gala in 2016, neither ever confirmed if that was the night their paths crossed for the first time. However, if the lyric from "Dress" is about the actor, they must have met in May, as Taylor Swift dyed her hair a slightly darker shade of blonde in June which means that she wasn't platinum anymore.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="10 Things Taylor Swift Has Done Since She Started Dating Joe Alwyn">10 Things Taylor Swift Has Done Since She Started Dating Joe Alwyn</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbaledOasKWnomLAuLXFrWSmnZWpeqO72J%2Bpop2emXqru8RmmKWvqaN6or7EZquhnaliwLW1y6VkraeXmsGpsdFmaWlqYmQ%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./what-happened-to-rey-mysterio-face.html>&#171;&nbsp;What Happened To Rey Mysterio Face?
